-- LAUREM is a brand-new recruitment portal.
-- Existing recruitment_* records belong to the legacy/BIMED portal and are
-- deliberately NOT part of LAUREM. This corrective migration removes only
-- rows previously copied into the LAUREM-prefixed namespace.
-- The shared/source tables are never modified.
